# Python-Budgeting-Program-Example
This program will allow a user to analyze their ability to balance a budget for the amount of months that they enter. This program will use functions and also a for loop. The program begins with asking for how many months that the user would like to analyze their budget. Then for each month, the user will input how much they budgeted and how much they spent. The program then decides wether the user has matched the budget to the amount spent, gone over the budget, or gone under the budget. The program will then display the results for each month.
